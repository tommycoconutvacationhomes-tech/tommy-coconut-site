## üé® Common Customizations

### Change Colors
Find and replace these hex codes throughout the HTML:

| What | Current | Replace With |
|------|---------|--------------|
| Primary Teal | `#62D0C9` | Your color |
| Navy | `#005A5B` | Your color |
| Gold Stars | `#FFD700` | Your color |
| WhatsApp | `#25D366` | Your color |

### Change Fonts
Replace all instances of:
```css
font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
```
With your preferred font.

### Adjust Spacing
Find `padding:` or `margin:` values and modify:
```css
padding: 80px 20px;  /* Vertical: 80px, Horizontal: 20px */
```

### Update Images
Replace Cloudinary URLs with your own:
```html
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/.../your-image.jpg">
```

---

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

All components are already mobile-responsive using:
- Flexible grid layouts (`grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(...))`)
- Responsive font sizes (`clamp(min, preferred, max)`)
- Flexible spacing (percentage-based)
- Stacking columns on small screens

**No additional work needed!** Just test to verify.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Lodgify Limitations

### What Works
‚úÖ Inline CSS (all styles in `style=""` attributes)
‚úÖ Cloudinary hosted images
‚úÖ Google Fonts CDN
‚úÖ Responsive layouts
‚úÖ HTML5 video backgrounds
‚úÖ Internal links

### What Might Not Work
‚ùå External JavaScript files
‚ùå External CSS stylesheets (use inline instead)
‚ùå Complex animations (keep it simple)
‚ùå Form submissions (use Lodgify's built-in forms)
‚ùå Third-party widgets that require scripts

### Workarounds
If something doesn't work:
1. **Move CSS inline** - Use `style=""` attributes
2. **Simplify animations** - Use basic CSS transitions
3. **Use Lodgify features** - For booking forms, calendars, etc.
4. **Test incrementally** - Add one component at a time

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: Images don't load
**Solution:** Check that Cloudinary URLs are correct and public

### Problem: Layout breaks on mobile
**Solution:** Check that Lodgify isn't adding conflicting CSS. Add `!important` to critical styles.

### Problem: Colors look different
**Solution:** Lodgify may have default theme colors. Override with inline styles using `!important`.

### Problem: Buttons don't work
**Solution:** Verify `href="#"` attributes point to actual pages, not just `#`.

### Problem: Video doesn't autoplay
**Solution:** Some browsers block autoplay. Add `muted` attribute (already included).

### Problem: Fonts don't load
**Solution:** Ensure Google Fonts link is in the page header. May need to contact Lodgify support.

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Test Increments
Don't paste all components at once. Add one, test, then move to the next.

### Tip 2: Keep Originals
Save a backup copy of each component before customizing. Makes it easy to start over.

### Tip 3: Use Browser DevTools
Right-click any element ‚Üí "Inspect" to see live CSS and test changes.

### Tip 4: Match Lodgify's Style
If Lodgify has a header/footer, style your components to blend seamlessly.

### Tip 5: Optimize Images
Use Cloudinary transformations to reduce file sizes:
```
?w_800&q_auto&f_auto
```

### Tip 6: A/B Test Headlines
Try different hero headlines and track which converts better.

### Tip 7: Update Regularly
Keep stats (guest numbers, reviews) current to maintain credibility.

### Tip 8: Mobile-First
Always check mobile view first - most users browse on phones.

### Tip 9: Speed Matters
Lodgify may be slower than your custom site. Optimize everything.

### Tip 10: Get Feedback
Show a colleague or friend before going live. Fresh eyes catch issues.
