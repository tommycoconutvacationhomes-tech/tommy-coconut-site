# Hero Carousel Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Slide 2 Image Not Displaying (404 Error)

**Problem:**
- Slide 2 was using a non-existent Cloudinary image URL
- Original URL: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dhschyq40/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/abe759c3-b45d-45f5-8403-8b8c5e33b7ad_zio4dx`
- This URL returned HTTP 404 - Resource not found

**Root Cause:**
- The image ID `abe759c3-b45d-45f5-8403-8b8c5e33b7ad_zio4dx` does not exist in the Cloudinary account
- This was likely a UUID that was never uploaded or was deleted

**Solution:**
- Replaced with a working villa image that matches the "Villa Life" theme of Slide 2
- New URL: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dhschyq40/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,w_1920/tommy-coconut/villas/dushi-hideaway`
- This image shows Villa Dushi Hideaway, which perfectly matches the slide's message: "Where luxury feels like home"

### Issue 2: Auto-Play Not Working (Perceived Issue)

**Problem:**
- User reported that slides were not auto-playing

**Root Cause:**
- The auto-play JavaScript was actually working correctly all along
- The broken image on Slide 2 created the illusion that the carousel wasn't functioning
- When the carousel auto-advanced from Slide 1 to Slide 2, users saw a blank/broken image, making them think the carousel had stopped

**Solution:**
- No JavaScript changes were needed - the autoplay functionality was already correctly implemented
- Fixing Slide 2's image resolved this perceived issue
- The carousel now visibly transitions between all 6 slides every 6 seconds

**Auto-Play Configuration (Already Correct):**
- Interval: 6 seconds (6000ms)
- Starts automatically on page load
- Pauses when user hovers over hero section
- Pauses when browser tab is hidden
- Resets when user manually navigates with dots or keyboard
