            <div class="intro-text">
                There's a reason Juan Carlos earned the nickname "MacGyver" – and it has nothing to do with his hairstyle. In a world where most people see problems, Juan Carlos sees puzzles waiting to be solved. Armed with nothing more than island ingenuity, a toolbox that seems to contain everything, and an unshakeable belief that every challenge has a solution, he's the family member who turns potential disasters into stories guests laugh about later.
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Island Alchemist</h2>
                <p>Juan Carlos possesses that rare combination of technical skill and creative thinking that makes him invaluable in the hospitality business. When something breaks (and in tropical environments, something always breaks), Juan Carlos doesn't just fix it – he often improves it in the process.</p>
                
                <p>His approach to problem-solving is rooted in what islanders call <span class="papiamento-word" data-translation="creative resourcefulness">kreatividad práktiko</span> – the art of making do with what you have while creating something better than what you started with. Whether it's a malfunctioning air conditioner, a stubborn pool pump, or a villa feature that needs a creative upgrade, Juan Carlos tackles every challenge with the same methodical enthusiasm.</p>
                
                <p>What makes him truly special is his ability to anticipate problems before they become problems. He has an intuitive understanding of how things work, how they break, and how to keep them running smoothly. His <span class="papiamento-word" data-translation="preventive wisdom">sabiduría preventivo</span> means guests often never know how close they came to inconvenience because Juan Carlos solved it before it became visible.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote-section">
                <p class="quote-text">He doesn't just fix things – he makes them better than they were before. It's like having a genius inventor on the family team.</p>
                <p class="quote-author">– Ray Coconut</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Invisible Guardian</h2>
                <p>Juan Carlos operates mostly behind the scenes, which is exactly how he likes it. While guests are enjoying their perfect vacation experience, he's ensuring that every system, every appliance, every detail of their environment is working flawlessly. His work is measured not by what guests notice, but by what they don't have to think about.</p>
                
                <p>He has an almost supernatural ability to diagnose problems quickly and accurately. Give him five minutes with a malfunctioning device, and he'll not only tell you what's wrong but will likely have already started fixing it using materials you didn't know could serve that purpose.</p>
                
                <p>His toolkit is legendary among the family – part traditional tools, part improvised solutions, part mysterious items that somehow always turn out to be exactly what's needed. Juan Carlos embodies the Caribbean principle of <span class="papiamento-word" data-translation="making it work">laga traha</span> – finding a way to make things work, no matter what obstacles present themselves.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Innovation Engine</h2>
                <p>But Juan Carlos isn't just about fixing problems – he's about preventing them and improving experiences. He constantly looks for ways to enhance villa functionality, create more convenient solutions for guests, and implement upgrades that make everyone's life easier.</p>
                
                <p>His innovations often seem simple in hindsight, but they represent hours of careful observation, creative thinking, and precise execution. He understands that the best solutions are often the ones that seem obvious once they're implemented but that no one else thought of before.</p>
                
                <p>Working with Juan Carlos has taught the entire family that there's almost always a way to make things better, that limitations are usually just starting points for creativity, and that the right combination of skill, imagination, and <span class="papiamento-word" data-translation="determination">determinashon</span> can overcome almost any challenge.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote-section">
                <p class="quote-text">Juan Carlos doesn't just maintain our properties – he continuously improves them. Every stay benefits from his innovations.</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Teaching Master</h2>
                <p>One of Juan Carlos's greatest gifts is his willingness to share his knowledge. He's always ready to teach family members how to handle basic maintenance tasks, understand how systems work, and develop their own problem-solving skills. His patient, methodical approach to explanation makes complex concepts accessible to everyone.</p>
                
                <p>He believes that knowledge should be shared, that everyone benefits when more people understand how things work.
