                                <p>Tommy Coconut is the legendary treasure hunter who inspired our philosophy. After spending 15 years chasing a ghost ship, he discovered that the real treasure wasn't gold - it was the feeling of total freedom, deep relaxation, and connection to the people you love.</p>
                                <p>While Tommy himself is notoriously bad with schedules and far too fond of his afternoon nap, you'll experience his philosophy through our family - Ray, Boy, Raymonde, and Kim. We are the custodians of Tommy's vision, the architects of your experience.</p>
                                <p>You might catch a glimpse of Tommy relaxing in his hammock, but the real magic happens through the family he chose to carry on his legacy.</p>

                                <p>Absolutely. For bookings made more than 60 days in advance, you can secure your dates with a 50% deposit. The remaining balance is then due 30 days prior to your arrival. It's just another way we make planning your perfect escape effortless.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Secure your preferred dates early</strong> - Lock in your vacation without the full financial commitment upfront</li>
                                    <li><strong>Plan your budget</strong> - Spread the cost over time to make it easier on your finances</li>
                                    <li><strong>Book with confidence</strong> - Reserve your Tommy Coconut experience when inspiration strikes</li>
