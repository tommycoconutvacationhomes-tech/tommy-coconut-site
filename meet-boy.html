            <div class="intro-text">
                At barely ten years old, Boy Coconut possesses something most adults spend their entire lives trying to recapture: the ability to find magic in every single moment. As the youngest member of the Tommy Coconut family, he doesn't just welcome guests – he transforms them into friends, co-conspirators, and fellow adventurers in the grand story of Curaçao.
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Natural Born Host</h2>
                <p>Don't let his age fool you. Boy has been greeting guests since he could walk, and his instinct for hospitality runs deeper than the Caribbean Sea. While other children might be shy around strangers, Boy sees every new arrival as a potential playmate, a new story to discover, a fresh adventure waiting to unfold.</p>
                
                <p>He's the one who'll race to carry your luggage (even if it's twice his size), the one who'll insist on giving you the "real tour" of the property – which always includes secret spots only he knows about, the best place to spot iguanas, and his personal favorite swimming hole.</p>
                
                <p>In Papiamento, we call this natural gift <span class="papiamento-word" data-translation="natural gift">don natural</span>. Some people learn hospitality; Boy was born with it flowing through his veins like island sunshine.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote-section">
                <p class="quote-text">He doesn't just make you feel welcome – he makes you feel like family within minutes of meeting him.</p>

            </div>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Joy Multiplier</h2>
                <p>What makes Boy truly special isn't just his energy – it's how that energy becomes contagious. Watch him interact with guests and you'll witness something remarkable: adults who arrived stressed and tired suddenly find themselves laughing, playing, and rediscovering their own sense of wonder.</p>
                
                <p>He's mastered the art of <span class="papiamento-word" data-translation="pure joy">alegria puru</span> – the kind of unfiltered happiness that reminds everyone around him what vacation is really supposed to feel like. Whether he's organizing an impromptu beach volleyball game, teaching guests his favorite Papiamento phrases, or simply sharing his latest discovery (a new type of hermit crab, a cool shell, a perfect skipping stone), Boy has this incredible ability to make everything feel like an adventure.</p>
                
                <p>The other family members often joke that Boy doesn't just host guests – he <span class="papiamento-word" data-translation="adopts">adopta</span> them. By the end of their stay, most guests have Boy's drawings, promises to write letters, and a collection of "very important" shells he's gifted them.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Learning the Legacy</h2>
                <p>Under the watchful and loving guidance of Tommy, Raymonde, and the entire family, Boy is learning that hospitality isn't just about making people comfortable – it's about creating memories that last a lifetime. He absorbs every lesson like a sponge, but adds his own unique twist to everything.</p>
                
                <p>Watch him help in the kitchen and you'll see him turn meal prep into a game. See him assist with villa preparations and he transforms cleaning into a treasure hunt. Everything Boy touches becomes infused with play, laughter, and genuine care.</p>
                
                <p>He's learning the business, yes, but more importantly, he's learning the heart of what makes Tommy Coconut Vacations special – the belief that every guest deserves to feel the pure <span class="papiamento-word" data-translation="happiness">felicidad</span> that comes from being truly seen, welcomed, and celebrated.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote-section">
                <p class="quote-text">Boy doesn't just represent the future of our family business – he represents the future of genuine, heartfelt hospitality itself.</p>

                <h2>The Little Boss Legacy</h2>
                <p>His nickname "Little Boss" isn't just about his age – it's about his natural leadership ability, his confidence in making guests feel at home, and his instinctive understanding of what people need to feel happy and cared for.</p>
                
                <p>Boy represents everything hopeful and beautiful about the future of Caribbean hospitality. In a world that sometimes feels too serious, too disconnected, too rushed, he reminds us all of the power of genuine human connection, unbridled enthusiasm, and the simple magic of treating every person you meet like they're the most important person in the world.</p>
                
                <p>When you stay with the Tommy Coconut family, Boy won't just be part of your vacation experience – he'll be the part you remember most, the part that makes you smile months later, the part that makes you want to come back not just to Curaçao, but to this feeling of being absolutely, completely, joyfully welcome.</p>
