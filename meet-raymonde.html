            <div class="intro-text">
                Behind every successful family operation, there's someone who makes sure everything actually gets done – and done right. For the Tommy Coconut family, that someone is Raymonde, affectionately known as "Jefa" (the boss). While Tommy dreams big and the family creates magic, Raymonde is the steady force who transforms vision into reality, chaos into order, and good intentions into exceptional results.
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Backbone of Excellence</h2>
                <p>Raymonde possesses that rare combination of strategic thinking and flawless execution that every successful operation needs but few are lucky enough to find. She doesn't just manage tasks – she anticipates needs, prevents problems before they arise, and creates systems that allow everyone else to focus on what they do best.</p>
                
                <p>Her approach is rooted in what Curaçaoans call <span class="papiamento-word" data-translation="attention to detail">detaye importante</span> – the understanding that excellence lives in the details, and that taking care of the small things is what makes the big things possible. Whether she's coordinating arrivals, managing supplies, or ensuring that every family member knows their role for the day, Raymonde brings a level of organization that feels almost effortless to everyone around her.</p>
                
                <p>But don't mistake her efficiency for coldness. Raymonde's organizational skills are powered by love – love for her family, love for their mission, and love for ensuring that every guest receives the extraordinary experience they deserve. Her <span class="papiamento-word" data-translation="leadership">liderazgo</span> style is both firm and nurturing, creating structure while maintaining the warmth that defines the Tommy Coconut experience.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote-section">
                <p class="quote-text">Raymonde doesn't just keep us organized – she keeps us focused on what matters most: creating unforgettable experiences for our guests.</p>
                <p class="quote-author">– Tommy Coconut</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Master Coordinator</h2>
                <p>Watch Raymonde in action and you'll witness organizational artistry. She has an intuitive understanding of timing, logistics, and human dynamics that allows her to orchestrate complex operations while making it look simple. She knows exactly when to delegate, when to step in personally, and when to give people the space to excel in their own roles.</p>
                
                <p>Her influence extends beyond just managing schedules and supplies. Raymonde understands that true hospitality requires emotional intelligence – knowing when a guest needs extra attention, when a family member needs support, and when a situation requires her particular brand of calm, confident leadership.</p>
                
                <p>She's particularly gifted at what we might call "invisible management" – creating conditions where everything flows smoothly without guests ever sensing the complexity behind the scenes. Her <span class="papiamento-word" data-translation="wisdom">sabiduria</span> lies in understanding that the best organizational systems are the ones people don't notice because they work so seamlessly.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Cultural Bridge</h2>
                <p>Raymonde brings a deep understanding of Curaçaoan culture and values to the family operation, ensuring that their hospitality remains authentically Caribbean while meeting international standards of excellence. She serves as a bridge between traditional island ways of doing things and the modern expectations of global travelers.</p>
                
                <p>Her leadership style reflects the best of Caribbean culture: she's direct when she needs to be, but always with respect and care. She understands that efficiency doesn't have to come at the expense of humanity, and that the best organizations are those where people feel valued, supported, and empowered to contribute their best work.</p>
                
                <p>Through her example, she teaches the entire family team that <span class="papiamento-word" data-translation="responsibility">responsabilidad</span> and love aren't opposing forces – they're complementary powers that, when combined, create something extraordinary.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="quote-section">
                <p class="quote-text">She has this incredible ability to see the big picture while never losing sight of the small details that make all the difference.</p>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>The Legacy of Leadership</h2>
                <p>Raymonde's influence on the Tommy Coconut family extends far beyond day-to-day operations. She's creating a legacy of leadership that demonstrates how organization and care can work together, how high standards and warm humanity can coexist, and how the right systems can actually enhance rather than constrain the magic of genuine hospitality.</p>
                
                <p>Her approach teaches everyone around her that being organized isn't about being rigid – it's about creating freedom.
